### HTLML
* When using the `<img />` tag, always provide alternative text using the `alt` attribute for webiste readers. This will for example help visually impaired individuals scan/read through the webiste withoou seeing a thing 
* the `public folder üìÅ` in in th HTML projects usually contains all the .HTML files that are not index.html

### CSS
* The `id = ""` attribute identifies elements uniqely while the `class = ""` attribute can be shared by multiple elements.
* ` a pt ( a point metric) ` is what MS office uses. E.g when the font siz is 12, it implies  12 pt (12 points). This can give a rough idea of the font-size/weight one is setting. A `px` is smaller.`em` is ralative to the parent and   `rem is raltive` to the root element e.g `<html> </html>`
* In CSS, font-size adjusts text size while font-weight controls text thickness or boldness.
* Use the `div elemetn`to layout or style elements together. It groups elements.
* use the `pesticide` extension to visualise `<div> </div>`
* The `height` and `width` properties are for the inner most box (where the content of the element is to be placed). This can pause challnegs when calculating the dimentions of your element. To resolve this, use the `box-sizing: border-box` property. This which make the height and width property refere to the height of the elememt up to the border (excluding the margin). This can simplify calcualtions.<br><br>

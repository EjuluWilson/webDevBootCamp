Exercise
Create a program that simulates downloading files from the internet. Your program should:

Define a downloadFile function that takes two parameters: the name of the file and a callback function.
Simulate the download process using setTimeout, where each file takes a random amount of time between 1 to 3 seconds to download.
After the download is complete, the callback function should be called with the name of the downloaded file.
Define a callback function processDownloadedFile that logs the downloaded file's name to the console.
Download three different files ("file1.txt", "file2.txt", "file3.txt") using the downloadFile function and process each file using the processDownloadedFile callback function.
Requirements
Use a random delay between 1 to 3 seconds to simulate the download time.
Ensure each file's download completion is logged to the console.
Steps to Follow
Implement the downloadFile function to simulate the download process.
Implement the processDownloadedFile callback function to log the downloaded file's name.
Call the downloadFile function three times with different file names and the same callback function.
Write the code from scratch based on these instructions and share it here for analysis.
